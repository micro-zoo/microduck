//! The NFC reader: a CLRC663 on USB serial, reading NTAG215 tags.
//!
//! A port of `ntag663` from the winnie repo, cut down to what `nfcd` does — find a tag, read its
//! NDEF — and without its writer, which stays a bench tool on a laptop. The measurements behind
//! the driver's choices (two soft resets, a field reset before every WUPA, no IRQ polling loop)
//! were made on that board and are kept next to the code they justify.
//!
//! Layered as the Python is: [`transport`] frames register accesses over the serial link,
//! [`clrc663`] is the chip, [`tag`] is ISO-14443A selection and the Type 2 reads, [`ndef`] is
//! pure parsing. [`pairing`] is what `nfcd` does with a tag, and is the part worth testing on a
//! laptop.
